# ip-bot
Bot that parses my ip and sends it via discord when someone writes !ip.

To use the bot it is necessary to download node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and both discord.js and public-ip modules use (npm install discord.js & npm install public-ip) on cmd/terminal.

To run the bot use the .sh files included if you are on Linux or change the extension of the files to .bat and use that to run on Windows.

Change the YourTokenHere on bot.js for your discords bot token.
